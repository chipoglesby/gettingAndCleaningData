This is the codebook for the [Getting and Cleaning data class on Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/)
```{r}
head(finalData,5)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
